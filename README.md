Seed is an engaging AI text-based game that blends interactive storytelling and language learning from large multimodal models.

# Welcome to the Seed GitHub Repository!
Seed is an engaging AI text-based game powered by large multimodal models (LLMs). With simple prompts and open experiences, it provides a unique platform for interaction and learning.

# Why Play Seed or Call It a Game?
Playing ‘Seed’ gives the LLMs a game context, making the interaction more engaging and enjoyable. It’s not just about asking questions or getting information. It’s about embarking on an adventure, exploring different themes, and learning along the way. Another compelling reason to frame the interaction with the language model as a game is the consistency it brings to the model’s responses. When provided with a game-playing context, the language model maintains a consistent mode in its responses, enhancing the coherence and continuity of the interaction. This consistent context can lead to a more immersive and engaging user experience.

# Features
Configurability
Seed is highly configurable. Players can establish the initial context or theme for the interaction, and they’re free to change it at any time.

# LLM Comparisons and Diagnostics
Playing Seed can provide valuable insights into the capabilities and behaviors of different LLMs. This can be useful for comparison and diagnostic purposes.

# Research and Development Discovery
Seed can serve as a platform for research and development. By observing how players interact with the game and how the LLMs respond, we can discover new ways to improve and evolve the game.

# Inspiration
Seed is designed to inspire. Whether it’s the eloquence of the game master’s responses or the imaginative scenarios you explore, Seed is a source of inspiration for players.

# Strengthen Vocabulary and Explore Literature Styles
In ‘Seed’, the game master not only incorporates SAT exam words in its responses to challenge player comprehension and strengthen their vocabulary, but also adapts to various literature styles. This feature allows players to immerse themselves in different literary atmospheres, ranging from the eloquence of Charles Dickens’ literature to a diverse array of works. The literature style can be updated in the initial prompt, providing a versatile and enriching language experience.
